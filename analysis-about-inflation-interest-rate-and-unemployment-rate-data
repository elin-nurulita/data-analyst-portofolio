# 📈 Analysis of Inflation, Interest Rate, and Unemployment (2000–2017)

## 📘 Overview
This project explores the relationship between **inflation (GDP Deflator)**, **unemployment rate (ILO Estimated)**, and **real interest rate** across **266 countries** over a **17-year period (2000–2017)**.  
The analysis aims to examine whether the empirical data aligns with classical macroeconomic theories or reflects different dynamics in modern economies.

## 🎯 Objective
To analyze how inflation, unemployment, and interest rates interact across countries and years, and determine whether the observed relationships are consistent with the following economic theories:

### 📚 Relevant Theories
- **Phillips (1958):** There is an inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment.  
- **Fisher (1930s):** Nominal interest rates move one-to-one with expected inflation.  
- **Keynes (1936):** High interest rates can reduce investment and increase unemployment.

## 🧩 Tools & Data Source
- **Data Source:** [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/) (Global historical macroeconomic data)  
- **Tool Used:** Google BigQuery for data exploration and correlation analysis  
- **Scope:** 266 countries, period 2000–2017  
- **Variables:**
  - GDP Deflator (% growth) → Inflation rate  
  - Real Interest Rate (%)  
  - Unemployment Rate (% of labor force)

## 📊 Findings & Insights

Based on cross-country data from 2000–2017:
- **Inflation and Interest Rate:** Tend to move in *opposite* directions, rather than the one-to-one pattern predicted by the **Fisher Effect**.  
- **Interest Rate and Unemployment:** Tend to move *together*, indicating possible monetary tightening effects on job markets.  

### 🧠 Possible Explanations:
1. **Non-traditional monetary policies:**  
   Central banks may lower interest rates even during inflationary periods to stimulate growth, maintain currency stability, or attract foreign investment.  

2. **Cost-push inflation or external shocks:**  
   When inflation arises from higher production costs or external pressures, monetary authorities may prioritize economic stability over theoretical rate adjustments.  

3. **Tight monetary policy effects:**  
   Higher interest rates can increase borrowing costs, reducing investment and employment — explaining the positive link between interest rates and unemployment.  

4. **Structural differences among countries:**  
   Developing nations often focus on short-term stabilization rather than strict inflation targeting, leading to deviations from classical theory.

## 📈 Conclusion
The results show that the relationships among inflation, interest rate, and unemployment **do not always follow classical macroeconomic theories**.  
Instead, they are shaped by **policy decisions, structural factors, and economic context**.  
This highlights the complexity of applying traditional models universally across diverse economies.
